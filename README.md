# FOMMStyle: Real-time Video Generation with Enhanced First Order Motion Model with StyleGAN

> Real-time facial animation with enhanced realism and style control, powered by First Order Motion Model (FOMM) and StyleGAN.

This repository is based on

- [First Order Motion Model for Image Animation](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model)
