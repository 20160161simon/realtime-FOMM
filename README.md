# realtime-FOMM: Real-time Video Generation with Enhanced First Order Motion Model with StyleGAN

> Real-time facial animation, powered by First Order Motion Model (FOMM) and FAN-face

This repository is a heavily modified fork of the [First Order Motion Model for Image Animation](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model) and also incorporates components from [FAN-face](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment)

Note: 

- GPU is needed, and we only test this model using RTX 3060 (6 GB, Laptop).
- This project is only for windows system.

## Example Animation

This is a demo of our project. The left side shows the camera feed, and the right side shows the model's real-time output.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/20160161simon/realtime-FOMM.git
cd realtime-fomm-stylegan
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Pretrained Models

- [Google Drive]()
- [Tsinghua Cloud](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/45fc365437414f95be4e/)

Then, place the checkpoint file in the `checkpoints` folder. There's no need to extract itâ€”keeping the `.tar` file as-is is fine.

### 3. Run a demo

```
python camera.py
```

## Training Your Own Model

If you want to train your own model, please follow the instructions provided in the [First Order Motion Model for Image Animation](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model). 

**(!!!)** Please note that the original dataset downloader is no longer functional. We have fixed the issue and included the updated version in the `dataset_downloader` folder. For detailed usage instructions, refer to the `README.md` file inside that folder.
